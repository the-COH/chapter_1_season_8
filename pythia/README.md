# Pythia

Pythia provides cryptographically secure and verifiable randomness. It focuses on providing simple, cost efficient and scalable solution.

# Key features

- On-chain verification: Pythia verifies the random number generation process on-chain, ensuring that the response received by the user is tamper-proof.

- Subscription model: Users subscribe to Pythia's service and pay for the gas fees needed for their requests. This eliminates the need to pay for unused services.

- Real-time application suitability: Pythia is well-suited for live and real-time applications because it ensures the integrity of the results.

- Bulk requests: Users can request multiple random numbers (up to 100) in a single request, making it efficient for certain use cases.
