## **Petals & Pixels: Mood-Mapped Artistry**

**Project Overview**
Petals & Pixels is a phydigital (physical and digital) art project that allows users to create unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) based on their current mood, time, and location. Developed by artist Hanaknight, this project is part of her genesis collection on the Canto platform.

The minted pieces have a slight "customization" to the base art piece, depending on the user's local system time and their selected "mood". This collection is Hanaknight's first collage-based work, comprised of dried flower art, upcycled photography prints and original poetry. It is also her first generative collection drop.
