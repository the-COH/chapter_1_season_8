# Windfall
This is the main repo for Windfall staking. 


Windfall is a gamified staking platform, allowing users to forgo their individual staking rewards in return for a chance to win the entire pot's rewards instead.

All deposited CANTO are staked with active Validator nodes in order to accumulate rewards for these daily Windfall payouts. Every day, a single participant is randomly chosen to receive the group's stockpiled rewards.

The odds of an individual winning are directly proportional to a user's total staked amount (i.e. what percentage of the total pool they have contributed at the time of the drawing).

Each CANTO deposit is exchanged for an ERC721 token, which represents the staked position, grants the user the eligibility to win, and can be redeemed for the original deposit amount at any time.

These NFTs can be traded, bought, and sold on secondary markets, allowing participants to bypass the otherwise mandatory unbonding period Validator nodes require.
