## About

Canto-shell is a blockchain explorer on the command line. It allows READ (and WRITE?) commands in a way that is very similar to interacting with popular command lines like bash, zsh or fish. Therefore you can keep your usual workflow on the command line. The only difference is that you now navigate on the Canto blockchain.
