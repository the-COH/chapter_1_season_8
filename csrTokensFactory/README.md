# csrYourToken

This new product gives users the ability to permissionlessly deploy CSR wrapper contracts for any ERC-20 token. This will allow them and any other holder of the token to wrap to a CSR version of said token, and claim CSR rewards generated via usage of this newly created csrToken.

Communities and token holders now have the ability to create extra revenue for themselves with no economic risk by deploying these wrapper contracts, and claiming CSR rewards!
